One of the key roles of an Operating System is virtualizing memory. When physical memory is abstracted into virtual memory, more than one process can be loaded and have access to memory at a time. A key way this happens is through address spaces and data structures such as stacks and heaps that grow in opposite directions. Virtualizing memory in this way protects programs from one another, and protects the OS itself (p.2-6).
