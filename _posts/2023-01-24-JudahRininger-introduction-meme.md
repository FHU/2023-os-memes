explaining a joke is like disecting a frog. you learn a lot, but it dies in the process. that being said. The joke is that before multiprograming all of a computers resources would be spent on one task at a time. it's probably not the best execution because those tasks could be completed so fast by even an old computer that the time differential wouldn't matter and the real purpose is probably just running multiple complicated programs at a time, to fully utilize a hardwares power during downtime in one program that's running. I just thought it would be funny minimizing the issue to something tiny because you can't do those two small things at the same time.
