With one CPU, only one program can be run at a time. This can be fixed by virtualizing the CPU. The OS gives the impression that the machine has multiple virtual CPUs, allowing multiple programs to be run at the same time. It allows the OS to switch resources between processes as needed to decrease the time required to run those programs separately.
