The fairness metric is simply the time the first job completes divided 
by the time that the second job completes. It ranges from .0 to 1, with 0 being the least fair and 1 being the most fair. When jobs finish at nearly the same time, F will be quite close to 1.
In this scenario, that is our goal: a perfectly fair scheduler would achieve
F = 1, all based on the lottery scheduler.
