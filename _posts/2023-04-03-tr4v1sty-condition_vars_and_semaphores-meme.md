This meme describes the producer/consumer problem in chapter 30 and 31. In ch 30 section 2 we learn that this problem is caused when the buffer (which needs to be in sync) gets out of sync due to a consumer trying to take something that isnt there and offseting it or when the producer trys to make when the buffer is at max.
