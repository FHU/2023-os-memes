In chapter 15, on page 2, it talks about a beautiful illusion: that the program has its own private memory, where its own code and data resides. This is created when the OS gets involved at key points to set up the hardware so that the correct translations take place, managing memory, keeping track of which locations are free and which are in use, and judiciously intervening to maintain control over how memory is used.
