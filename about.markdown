We are studying operating systems without a deep understanding of the C programming language. So instead of writing our own operating system, we are writing our own memes! This site is the final resting place for those memes.

Our wonderful book is open source: 

[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)  
Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau  
Arpaci-Dusseau Books  
August, 2018 (Version 1.00)  

We use GitHub pages to deploy a Jekyll site from this code using pull requests for student submissions. Those tools are both worthy of a Google search.
